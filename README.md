# Monthly Process
This is a slow and arduous process when done manually. It took approximately 1 and half weeks of an FTE every month to complete. It is now down to less than an hour with some elbow grease and liberal use of Python.
Error rate went from 6% to 0%, as it no longer relies on direct manual input and has been routinely overseen for edge cases.
